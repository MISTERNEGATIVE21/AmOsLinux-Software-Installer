# AmOs Linux Software Installer

What to do after the installation of the latest version of AmOs Linux, or any other arch based distro !!

Personally I will install these applications with the use of the scripts.
These are applications not everyone would want on an iso.
Get all the theming from AmOsLinux on xfce amd bspwm!
If you dont want some things just put a hashtag '#' infront.  

EndeavourOS example
